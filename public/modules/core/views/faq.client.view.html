            How are brands rated?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Answer</b>

            Consumers (users) rate business based on their interaction with them. Users assign ratings score and write reviews to describe the experiences with brands.

            How do you ensure against fraudulent ratings?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Answer</b>

            Each user can only register with a valid email address and this qualifies them to rate a brand one. They can edit or modify if the experience changes based on further interaction. Internally, we have installed an algorithm to detect unusual rating patterns. Once detected, such ratings are deleted.
